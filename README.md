# Advent of Code

This project houses Advent of Code solutions. The general contract is
that a an unmodified input file is read in, and the answer is found from
it without any manual steps. For some problems the input is a single number
or a alphanumeric string of only a few characters, in which case it's often
directly in the code.

This isn't universally true. :)
