# Advent of Code

This project houses Advent of Code solutions. The general contract is
that a an unmodified input file is read in, and the answer is found from
it without any manual steps. For some problems the input is a single number
or a alphanumeric string of only a few characters, in which case it's often
directly in the code.

This isn't universally true. :)

## 2015

The 2015 solutions are implemented in Go, and found in the Project Euler
repository at `git@github.com:barneyb/project-euler.git`.

Some of them were reimplemented in both Python and Haskell in the Advent of
Code repository at `git@github.com:barneyb/adventofcode.git`.

## 2016

The first 21 days of 2016 are implemented in Haskell, and found in the Advent
of Code repository at `git@github.com:barneyb/adventofcode.git`.

From day 22 onward are implemented in Kotlin in this repository (at
`git@github.com:barneyb/aoc2017.git`).

## 2017

The 2017 solutions are implemented in Kotlin in this (AoC 2017) repository
at `git@github.com:barneyb/aoc2017.git`.
